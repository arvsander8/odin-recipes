        This means Huancainan-style potato and comes from Huancayo, Peru. It's an easy-to-make dish of sliced potatoes
        with a special sauce.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 Yukon Gold potatoes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
        <li>6 chile peppers, halved lengthwise and seeded</li>
        <li>1 pound cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 pound queso fresco (Mexican fresh cheese), crumbled</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/3 cup evaporated milk</li>
        <li>4 hard-boiled eggs, halved lengthwise</li>
        <li>8 leaves lettuce</li>
        <li>8 black olives, pitted and halved</li>


    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and
            simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook onion until tender, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil. Boil chile peppers until soft, about 5 minutes. Run chiles under
            cold water to cool until cool enough to handle; remove and discard skins.</li>
        <li>Blend onion, chile peppers, cheese, vegetable oil, garlic, salt, and pepper in a blender until smooth.
            Stream evaporated milk into the blended mixture while continuing to blend until a creamy sauce is achieved.
        </li>
        <li>Arrange 1 lettuce leaf onto each of 8 plates. Halve potatoes and arrange 3 halves onto each lettuce leaf.
            Drizzle creamy sauce over the potatoes. Top each with an egg half and two black olive halves.</li>

    </ol>
