    <p>
        I will never forget the traditional peruvian rocoto. I am from Peru and I like to cook, I remember my granma
        preparing a red bell pepper when I saw the thin slices in the table. I never could have imagined that this
        was going to make me cry and barely breath, with my mouth on fire. I was not used to chili peppers, and
        especially to the extreme heat that made rocotos famous. Some people swear they can eat them fresh from the
        plant as apples, but I have never seen this… maybe that´s only when recently harvested. You can be sure that I
        won´t try this. Ever.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To tame the heat of the rocotos, cut the top of each one and using a spoon scrape the seeds and ribs from the inside. Be very careful, and it´s wise to use gloves to protect your hands, and wash them well when you finish. DO NOT touch your eyes!</li>
        <li>Put the rocotos in a pan with water to cover, a tablespoon of sugar, bring to a boil, turn off the heat, discard the water. Add more fresh water and repeat this operation three times. Drain and cool the rocotos. Reserve.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a saucepan over high heat, warm the oil, add the aji panca paste, beef and bay leaves. When cooked, add the onion, ¼ teaspoon sugar, salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add the peanuts, oregano, olives, hard-boiled eggs, parsley, raisins, salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Fill the rocotos with this mixture. Accommodate in a rectangular or square pyrex or baking pan.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, beat one egg with one can of evaporated milk, salt and pepper, and pour over the rocotos.</li>
        <li>Beat three eggs until very thick and put a tablespoon over each rocoto. Then cover with the reserved tops.</li>
        <li>Bake for 15 minutes in a 350F oven. Serve with the potato gratin.</li>
        <li>To make the potato gratin: Butter a baking pan or a pyrex, make one layer of potato slices, cover with queso fresco and a sprinkling of aniseed. Repeat three times.</li>
        <li>In a bowl whip the four eggs until very thick, add evaporated milk, salt and pepper. Pour over the potatoes and cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in a 350F oven until golden and thick.</li>
    </ol>
